# A Bedroom

Many jurisdictions define the properties that a room must have to be considered a bedroom in the context of real estate advertising. In Queensland, a room may be considered a bedroom if:

* the ceiling height is at least 2.4m
* the window area is at least 10% of the floor area
* the floor area is at least 6.5m2
