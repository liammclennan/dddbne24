### 001 title

### 002 how we got here

* Agile throws away the spec on work items
* Sommerville right about what, wrong about why, spec as a weapon

### 003 why we need specifications

* Apollo cost $257 billion in 2020 dollars and employed 400,000 people 
* "It's 1961" thought experiment
* "survive time" means memory fades and the spec is all that's left (and the code).
* rust example for separating thinking from doing

### 004 Problems with specs

* specification work has to be done anyway, but is it captured?

### 005 Prior art

* BDD is a way of writing tests that produces a specification. 

Pros: stays in sync, outside-in style encourages thinking before doing. 
Cons: Awkward way to write a spec. Have to be a programmer. 

### 006 A specification defining a bedroom

Diff with 006b.

Note that mocha/specflow style specs are much more difficult to read than plain md. 

### 008 Pong

Pong is a simple tennis simulation game. The player moves a paddle to hit the ball back at a wall. 

Beginning, collisions, misses.
