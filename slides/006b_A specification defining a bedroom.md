# A Bedroom

Many jurisdictions define the properties that a room must have to be considered a bedroom in the context of real estate advertising. In Queensland, a room may be considered a bedroom if:

* ::the ceiling height is at least 2.4m::{grep='must have a ceiling at least 2.4m'}
* ::the window area is at least 10% of the floor area::{grep='must have window area at least 10% of floor area'}
* ::the floor area is at least 6.5m2::{grep='must have floor area of at least 6.5m2'}
